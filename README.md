#Terminal Emulator for Android

TermOnePlus is a terminal emulator for communicating with the built-in Android shell.
It emulates a reasonably large subset of Digital Equipment Corporation VT-100 terminal codes.
Supported terminal types include vt100, screen (default), linux and xterm.
As result console programs like "vi" (unix visual editor), "emacs", "mc" (Midnight Commander file manager), nano (Nano's ANOther editor) and other work smoothly.

This application is clone of Jack Palevich's terminal emulator.

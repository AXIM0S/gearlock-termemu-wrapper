#Terminal Emulator for Android

TermOnePlus is a terminal emulator for communicating with the
built-in Android shell. It emulates a reasonably large subset of Digital
Equipment Corporation VT-100 terminal codes, so that programs like "vi", "Emacs"
and "NetHack" will display properly.

This application is clone of Jack Palevich's terminal emulator.
